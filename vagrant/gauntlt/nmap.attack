Feature: simple nmap attack (sanity check)

  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the target hostname is "regitry.test.lan"

  Scenario: Verify server is available on standard web ports
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p 22,80,443 <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
        22/tcp  open   ssh
        80/tcp  open   http
        443/tcp closed https
      """
