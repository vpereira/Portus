Feature: Run sslyze against a target

Background:
  Given "sslyze" is installed
  And the target hostname is "google.com"

Scenario: Ensure no anonymous certificates
  When I launch an "sslyze" attack with:
    """
      python /home/vagrant/sslyze/sslyze.py google.com:443
    """
  Then the output should not contain:
    """
    Anon
    """

# Scenario: Make sure that the certificate key size is at least 2048
#   Given the target hostname is "google.com"
#   When I launch an "sslyze" attack with:
#     """
#       python <sslyze_path> <hostname>:443
#     """
#   Then the key size should be at least 2048
